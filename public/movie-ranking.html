<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>
Set in Roman times, the story of a once-powerful general forced to become a common gladiator.<br/>
The emperor's son is enraged when he is passed over as heir in favour of his father's favourite general.<br/>
He kills his father and arranges the murder of the general's family, and the general is sold into slavery to be trained as a gladiator - but his subsequent popularity in the arena threatens the throne.

<h3>Breave Heart</h3>
<p>
William Wallace is the medieval Scottish patriot who is spurred into revolt against the English when the love of his life is slaughtered.<br/>
Leading his army into battles that become a war, his advance into England threatens King Edward I's throne before he is captured and executed, but not before becoming a symbol for a free Scotland.
</p>
<h3>Troy</h3>
<p>
Based on Homer's "Iliad," this epic portrays the battle between the ancient kingdoms of Troy and Sparta.<br/>
 While visiting Spartan King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) falls for Menelaus' wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), and takes her back to Troy.<br/>
  Menelaus' brother, King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), having already defeated every army in Greece, uses his brother's fury as a pretext to declare war against Troy, the last kingdom preventing his control over the Aegean Sea.
